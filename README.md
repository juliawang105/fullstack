## What is Learn It? 

Inspired by Brainscape, Learn It serves as an educational tool to serve learners and educators in their journey of acquiring knowledge and mastering different contents. This platform provides the learners the opportunity to create a personalized learning stack of information and to save decks created by others. 

Using technologies such as Rails, PostgreSQL, React.js, and Redux, Learn It was built from scratch in under two weeks. Currently, this version allows the creation of decks and cards and the ability to save and unsave decks created by other users.
